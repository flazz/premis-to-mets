Model
=====

Sip descriptor
-------------- 
treated as a normal datafile, but the information extracted is integral to the
processing of the SIP.

Aip descriptor
--------------
premis document, no mets. describes everything that happened to the package.
fixity of all files and verification of the descriptor (digital signature?) can
insure integrity of the AIP and all processing that took place prior.

Representations 
--------------- 
a representation is defined as the set of the most current version of each data
file from the SIP.

The original SIP is defined as R-0; The AIP after its first ingest is defined as
R-1; after a dissemination and ingest R-2; etc. 

The latest representation available can be though of as R-current. The most current
possbile representation can be described as R-max. R-current is only equal to R-max
if R-current is disseminated and then ingested and no transformations occur, else
R-current is one representation (ingest) behind R-max.

It is possible to dispose of all revisions but R-0 and R-current, in DAITSS1
architecture all files not in R-0 and R-current are disposable.

Localization
------------
at worse we keep a webslice, (not datafiles!)
TODO: look more at premis dependency.

Transformations
---------------
(xform: file1 -> file2)
file1, file2 are objects; xform is the agent; -> is event; derrivation is the relation between the two

File vs Bitstreams
------------------
Files contain bitstreams, size, paths, message digests, etc. every file with a known
format has at least one bitstream of that format. Bitstreams are represented using
format information.

Use Cases
=========
some uses cases that demonstrate the benefits of the AIP model.

archive to archive transfer
---------------------------
if the fixity of the files and authenticity of the descriptor are verified. the
information in the descriptor need not be reproduced.

recovery from disaster
----------------------
recovery from backup would be analogous to a archive to archive transfer from
backup tapes that the AIPs are stored on. if the package is verified and the
fixity of the files is intact all data can be loaded from the AIP without a full
ingestion.

recovering from incomplete ingest
---------------------------------
In the case the archive cannot fully ingest a SIP, the partial AIP can be saved
until the system is capable of completing it. like when part of the system is down
or when a bug fix need to happen.
